# Train ticket price calculator 2.0

## Instructions
Write a program that asks the user:
- The number of kilometers to travel
- Age of the passenger

Based on this information you will have to calculate the total price of the trip, according to these rules:
- The ticket price is defined based on km (0.21 € per km)
- A 20% discount applies for minors
- A 40% discount applies for those over 65

## MILESTONE 1:
We start by implementing the program without any aesthetics: using exclusively two inputs and a button (not stylized). 
The final response (or output) will also be written in the console.

## MILESTONE 2:
Only after milestone 1 is complete and functional will we create a form on the page where the user can enter the data and view the final calculation with the price. The data recap and the output of the final price must then be printed on the page (the price must be formatted with a maximum of two decimals, to indicate the cents on the price). This will require a little research.
